# **Hotel Booking Analysis and Insights**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand trends, booking behaviors, and factors influencing cancellations. The goal is to provide actionable insights for hotel management and improve decision-making.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **SQL**: Storing and querying the cleaned data.
- **Power BI**: Creating interactive dashboards.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

---

## **Steps**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Encoded categorical features and normalized numerical data.
   - Created new date-related features (e.g., month, day of the week).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends in cancellations, room types, and market segments.
   - Analyzed correlations between features (e.g., lead time and cancellations).
3. **Cancellation Insights**:
   - Identified key factors contributing to cancellations.
   - Studied customer segments and booking patterns.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Used Python for initial plots and Power BI for dynamic dashboards.
5. **Database Integration**:
   - Stored processed data in an SQL database for efficient querying.

---

## **Key Deliverables**
- **Python Scripts**: For cleaning and analyzing data.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations of booking trends and cancellation rates.
- **SQL Database**: Cleaned dataset and pre-defined queries.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Use predictive modeling to forecast cancellations.
- Automate data pipelines for preprocessing.
- Enhance real-time data integration into dashboards.
